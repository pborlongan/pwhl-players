# pwhl-players

Work in progress!

A directory of the current players of the Professional Women's Hockey League. Made with Vue.js.

The PWHL started their first season this year, I thought about creating this small project to help people get to know the players through a pok√©dex-like web app. I wanted to keep building and learning vue apps so why not build it with Vue.js too :)
